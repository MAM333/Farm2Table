# Farm2Table
This is an app developed for the PES subject, 3rd grade at Universitat Polit√©cnica de Catalunya, designed for the purchase and sale of local products.

The folder contains all the code made with React-Native, a javascript and html framework made to develop apps in android and ios at the same time.

This project only is pushed for the code visualization, because it doesn't have the back-end available.
